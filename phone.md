    <h2>My Phone</h2>
    <p>I always carry my phone with me. A phone is a basic answer, and even though I'm trying to cut down on my screentime, it's an essential in everyday life. I think my favorite thing about my phone and phones in general is how customizeable they are. I have a polaroid of my dog in my case and a picture of him as my lockscreen!</p>
