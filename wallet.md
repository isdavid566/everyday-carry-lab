# My **Wallet**
<img class="about" alt="pine" src="/images/pine.png" width="50" />

Wallets are pretty important. I don't use mine that often, as I carry a lot of cards in it, but I do carry my keys in it. I misplace my keys a lot so keeping them somewhere I know I won't lose is very helpful. I have my keys attached to a keychain, which dangles outside of my wallet. I also keep my bus pass in my wallet, which I do need to get to class.
